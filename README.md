# Arduino Ethernet Shield
* This board is created using Eagle CAD. The breakout board connects an Arduino Due A pin outs to a Adafruit Featherwing. 
* This allows the arduino to take advantage of the ethernet capabilities of the adafruit feather.
* The devices communicate through SPI, allowing TCP and UDP communications.

# Process of Manufacturing:
* First, we understand the requirements of the board. This board was a simple breakout board that only required the SPI connections and a few pinouts from the arduino to be connected to the feather. Therefore we first drew the schematic:

* We can also have a glimpse of the manufacturer's prototype of the board through Eagle's Manufacturer's Board option.

* After drawing the schematic, the floorplan of the board is next. This is where the floorplan was layed out on a physical board.

# Finished Product

* Once the schematics and floorplan were established, we download the gerber files and upload them to a manufacturer's website, where the boards are ordered. Below are some images of the finished product.
